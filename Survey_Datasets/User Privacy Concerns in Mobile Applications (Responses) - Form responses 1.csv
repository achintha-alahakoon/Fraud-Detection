All these happens because they don't know the limit to share their personal /sensitive details ,Making the terms and privacy catalogues more friendly to read and looking from the users point of view. Privacy protection in cyber world gonna be the key demand in near future. If the developers can upfront that feature it's gonna make a mutual benefit to both customers and device selling companies ,Mobile Apps are severely damaging to the confidentiality. Worst is people don't even know how they are being manipulated even after serious incidents.
